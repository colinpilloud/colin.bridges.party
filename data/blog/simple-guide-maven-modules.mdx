To keep your Maven project from spiraling out of control, it helps to break it into modules: packages of code and resources that serve a singular purpose. However, this adds an extra element of dependency management, since you'll need to specify how exactly your modules depend on each other.

Fortunately, multi-module projects offer an elegant solution to this problem. Rather than bombard you with example POMs, I'll point you to [Dropwizard's source on GitHub](https://github.com/dropwizard/dropwizard).

The first thing to check out is the POM file in the root of the project. This is the <strong>parent POM</strong>, from which all other POMs inherit. Any properties, dependencies, or plugin configurations defined here will be passed onto the POM's children. This means any POM that declares a parent POM and points to dropwizard-parent will benefit from the configuration specified here.

You'll note the presence of the <strong>modules</strong> node. Every module listed here corresponds with a directory in the project root (at the same level as the parent POM). When you execute a Maven command from the project root (e.g. mvn clean package), that command ripples across all the different modules.

When you do execute a command, what Maven does next is pretty interesting. It passes all of the children POMs into the [Maven Reactor](http://maven.apache.org/guides/mini/guide-multiple-modules.html), which determines the proper order to build the projects (since building them in the wrong order could lead to dependency issues).

Another section of note in the parent POM is `dependencyManagement`. On the surface, this node looks like extra dependencies. What it actually does is provide a centralized location for you to define dependency versions, without mandating that all children use those dependencies. From the `dependencyManagement` section of the Dropwizard parent POM:

```xml
<dependencyManagement>
   <dependencies>
       <dependency>
           <groupId>com.fasterxml.jackson.core</groupId>
           <artifactId>jackson-annotations</artifactId>
           <version>${jackson.api.version}</version>
       </dependency>
       <!-- ... -->
   </dependencies>
</dependencyManagement>
```

This means that any child POM can declare a dependency on `jackson-annotations` without specifying a version, and it'll resolve to the version defined in the parent. It also means that any child POM that does <em>not</em> declare a dependency on `jackson-annotations` won't have it packaged, which is what would happen if this dependency was declared under the regular dependencies node in the parent POM.

To boil it down, here's the essentials:
<ul>
  <li>Multi-module projects have a parent POM in the project's root</li>
  <li>Child POMs inherit properties, dependencies, and plugin configurations from the parent</li>
  <li>The parent POM has a <strong>modules</strong> node, with entries mapping to directories in the root, with each directory containing its own Maven project</li>
  <li>Maven commands executed at the root ripple across all the listed modules</li>
  <li>Maven's Reactor figures out the right order in which to build your projects</li>
</ul>
