I recently started playing with Google's web-starter-kit<sup>[1](#1)</sup>, intending to build upon its boilerplate for a personal project.

After downloading and extracting the zip, I went to install the dependencies using npm. I'd already had a previous version of node (and by association npm) installed, so as expected, running `npm install` successfully installed all the dependencies. 

However, when I went to run the `gulp serve` command to compile assets and serve the site locally, my shell couldn't find the `gulp` executable.

After a quick search, I realized what exactly running `npm install` did for me. According to the [CLI docs](https://www.npmjs.org/doc/cli/npm-install.html "npm-install"), npm has two methods of installing packages &ndash; without any flags, it defaults to installing them locally, i.e. within the `node_modules` folder. If you actually do want to install it globally, you can add the `-g` flag.

That's well and good, but where exactly are the executables? They're <em>inside the computer</em>.

More specifically, they're inside the `node_modules` folder, nested under `.bin`. You can append that to your $PATH environment variable like so:

```shell
export PATH=./node_modules/.bin:$PATH
```

And of course, you can make that permanent by adding that to your shell's profile.
