## Hi! <Twemoji emoji="waving hand" /> I'm Colin Bridges

I'm a career backend engineer who's done a little bit of everything.
I like programming on the JVM, but more generally I like writing
maintainable code that solves business problems.

I live in beautiful Southeast Portland with my wife and our four crazy
pets.

Outside of work, I like listening to metal, playing Magic: The Gathering<sup>TM</sup>,
watching sports, and attempting various home improvement projects.

Inside of work, I like...
- solving business problems with code. That's why we do it!
- working with teammates to build a fun, inclusive engineering culture.
- mentoring junior engineers, especially those new to backend engineering.
- establishing standards and building automation.
- folding useful functional programming concepts into everyday code.
