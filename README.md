My personal website, built on top of [this heavily modified](https://github.com/hta218/leohuynh.dev) version of the [tailwind-nextjs-starter-blog](https://github.com/timlrx/tailwind-nextjs-starter-blog) and then hacked up.

My huge thanks to [Timothy Lin](https://twitter.com/timlrxx) and [Leo Huynh](https://twitter.com/hta218_) for the heavy lifting. Deleting and modifying code is a lot easier than writing it from scratch, that's for sure, so thank you so much!
